introduction: This is the Civic. It was built for my son, who does in-fact, have a wild infatuation with the Honda Civic. This bicycle represents the first frame built by me, without the watchful eye of a master frame builder and teacher. I thought my first bike Lessons was aptly named, but being able to “create your own learning opportunities” is a different experience in the humbling nature of bicycle frame building.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
  The Green Man was dreamed and schemed up over beers at the Bike Bar in Ithaca,
  as a gravel grinder and all road machine for a good friend of mine. The actual
  concept of “the Green Man” came from a deep connection to the outdoors, and
  the ___ of a bicycle as a tool to experience and connect with the natural
  environment.
</p>
<h2>Design brief</h2>
<p>
  The Green Man is a gravel specific build. It will fit 650b x 47mm tires, has
  three bottle mounts (seat tube and both sides of the downtube), and rack
  mounts if a rear pannier rack is desired. Flat mount disc brake and through
  axel rear dropouts will keep things stiff and future proof. The steel gravel
  fork from Brother Cycles, has triple cage mounts and can do darn near any kind
  of packing you can dream up.
</p>
<h2>Build out details</h2>
<p>Mark really went all in on building his dream bike.</p>

  *Another great thing about this project is sharing the creative experience
  with my son who did all the photography and image production.
