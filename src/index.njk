	<p>
		Marteal Cycle Works (MCW) is grounded in the belief that everyone deserves
		to experience joy, adventure, and wonder on a bike. Every cyclist, whether
		an avid racer, an occasional tourer, or a total beginner deserves to be
		valued and respected as a person, a cyclist and a customer.
	</p>
	<p>
		MCW was founded by me, Bob Marteal, after years of cycling and shopping the
		market looking for good customer service and a bicycle that felt right. I
		often felt frustrated that there was no place for me in the market. In 2014
		after hours of research, I purchased what I thought would be my
		forever-bike. Shortly after, I began to feel it wasn’t quite right and
		didn’t feel I had anywhere to turn.

		<h2>Why a Custom Bicycle?</h2>
		<p>
			Bicycles available in stores are designed and built for riders of average
			height, weight, and length. For most cyclists, this leads to compromise.
			If you have ever had a bicycle that didn't quite fit or do what you need,
			a custom bicycle fit to your measurements and uses can be a dream come
			true.
